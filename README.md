This Bachelor project investigates B-splines, a type of piecewise polynomial function widely used
in mathematical modelling and numerical approximation. The study focuses on understanding
the mathematical properties of B-splines, such as their local support, continuity, and partition of
unity, which contribute to their efficiency and flexibility in various applications. Additionally, the
project explores a general theorem by Huang (1998) on the rate of convergence of functions to
their approximations within orthogonal projections, and discusses the conditions and factors that
influence this convergence. We provide detailed proofs of this result, which are not presented
in Huang’s paper, using various notions, such as functional analysis. Practical applications are
demonstrated through implementing B-splines in R, showing their effectiveness in data smoothing
and functional approximation. The results highlight the versatility and robustness of B-splines in
solving complex mathematical and statistical problems.
